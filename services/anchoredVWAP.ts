## Anchored VWAP Concept

**Definition**: Volume-weighted average price calculated from a specific event (anchor point)
**Purpose**: Estimate institutional investors' actual average entry price to identify support/resistance levels

### Key Anchor Points (Priority Order)

1. **Earnings Release** (Highest Priority)
   - Recent quarterly earnings announcement date
   - Very important if stock moved significantly after earnings

2. **52-Week Low** (Strong Support)
   - Date when 52-week low was recorded in the past year
   - VWAP from this point acts as strong support

3. **52-Week High** (Strong Resistance)
   - Date when 52-week high was recorded in the past year
   - VWAP from this point acts as resistance

4. **Major News Events**
   - Large capital raises, M&A, policy announcements, etc.
   - When trading volume spiked 3x or more

## Analysis Instructions

1. **Use Google Search**:
   - Find recent earnings announcement dates
   - Find 52-week high/low dates
   - Find major news event dates
   - Find current stock price

2. **VWAP Calculation (Conceptual)**:
   - Sum of (Price Ã— Volume) from anchor date to present / Sum of Volume
   - Since actual calculation is not possible, estimate as midpoint between anchor price and current price

3. **Support/Resistance Determination**:
   - Current Price > VWAP: VWAP acts as support (isSupport = true)
   - Current Price < VWAP: VWAP acts as resistance (isSupport = false)
   - Current price near VWAP (Â±2%): priceAction = 'approaching'
   - Bouncing from VWAP: priceAction = 'bouncing'
   - Breaking through VWAP: priceAction = 'breaking'

4. **Strength Calculation (0-100)**:
   - Anchor event importance (Earnings = 100, 52w low = 90, News = 70)
   - Volume spike (3x+ = +20 points)
   - Number of VWAP bounces (1 bounce = +10 points, max 30 points)

5. **Confidence Calculation**:
   - Based on Strength
   - Higher confidence when current price is closer to VWAP (Â±5% = high confidence)

## Output Format

For each stock, select **the single most important anchor point** and analyze in detail.
Exclude stocks with no valid anchor points.

**CRITICAL**:
- ticker must be exact stock code
- All responses in English
- Prices as numbers only (no currency symbols)
- Respond ONLY with a valid JSON array wrapped in markdown code blocks, like:
\`\`\`json

    "anchorDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
